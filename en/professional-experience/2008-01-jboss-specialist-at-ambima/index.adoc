I worked in supporting middleware's infrastructure that makes up the Selic application servers, at Central Bank ({RioDeJaneiro})).
I did the installation, configuration, and integration of many application servers ({JBossEAP}).
I also performed maintenance and monitoring of multiple instances (+ 30) in various environments (from development to production).
I did the refactoring of deployments automation solution for {JavaEE} applications that, in past, was using {Bash} scripts and {Ant}.
This refactoring was made using {Maven}.
I made the continuous integration solution using http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/[CruiseControl] and http://hudson-ci.org/[Hudson].
